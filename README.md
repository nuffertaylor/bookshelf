# ðŸ“š bookshelf ðŸ“š
a program that creates an image to display the spines of the books you've read

I've included a default bookshelf image and a few spines in the "example" folder to demonstrate how the program works. But you can feed it any bookshelf image, its dimensions, and a bunch of book spine files and their dimensions, and this program will create an image for you.
At some point in the future, I might make a website that does all this for you. Maybe we'll build a beautiful book spine API the whole world can use ðŸŒŽ
